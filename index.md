## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{"/assets/images/profile-pic.JPG" | relative_url}})

 
My name is David Kaufman, and I am Junior studying Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell University. I am passionate about everything aerospace from UAV to satellite development. I have a background in Integration and Test Engineering in complex environments including ultra-high vacuum, high vibration, and cryogenic thermal management. 

As an MAE 3050 Intro to Aerodynamics student this semester, I am designing and testing a lightweight glider to achieve maximum flight time over a set range. Our dominating considerations for this design challenge include maximizing aspect ratio for minimum possible weight. Our final design leverages optimized geometry for weight reduction and practical manufacturing processes.
